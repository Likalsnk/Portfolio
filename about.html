            <p>I'm a Graphic & UI/UX Designer who focuses on clarity, logic, and user behavior — not just visuals. I help products communicate clearly, feel intuitive, and guide users exactly where they need to go.</p>
            <p>I don't start with colors or trends. I start with questions:<br>
            <strong>Who is the user? What do they need? What should they feel and do next?</strong></p>
            <p>My design approach combines strong visual aesthetics with structured UX thinking. Every layout, element, and interaction has a purpose — to improve usability, trust, and conversion.</p>
            <p><strong>What working with me looks like:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>🧠 Clear structure and thoughtful user flows</li>
              <li>✨ Clean, modern visuals aligned with your brand</li>
              <li>📊 Design decisions backed by logic, not guesswork</li>
              <li>🤝 Reliable communication and attention to detail</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you're looking for a designer who thinks, analyzes, and designs with intention — let's talk about your project.</p>
