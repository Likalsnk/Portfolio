    "faq.hr.failure.title": "💡 Tell us about your failures (mistakes, setbacks) at work",
    "faq.hr.failure.intro": "One of the key responsibilities of a designer is the ability to justify decisions and advocate for users. In a mobile application project, we had already reached the high-fidelity design stage when the client suddenly requested a fully neon lime background — “very bright and trendy.”",
    "faq.hr.failure.p1.title": "⚠️ The Risk",
    "faq.hr.failure.p1.text": "I clearly understood the risks: poor text readability (contrast below 3:1 according to WCAG), eye strain, accessibility issues, and potentially high bounce rates.",
    "faq.hr.failure.p2.title": "🛡️ My Approach",
    "faq.hr.failure.p2.text": "I prepared structured arguments for the meeting:",

    "faq.hr.failure.p3.text": "However, the client insisted — it was a gift for his wife, and neon green was her favorite color. I proposed a compromise: to create two versions — his preferred one and a more user-friendly alternative. After reviewing both, he still chose his option.",
    "faq.hr.failure.p4.title": "🎓 Lesson Learned",
    "faq.hr.failure.p4.text": "I clearly documented all risks and ways to mitigate them. The app was released, and this case taught me an important lesson: <em>not all decisions are rational, but it is crucial to remain an honest advisor to the client and clearly communicate the potential consequences.</em>",
    "faq.hr.leading.title": "🧭 Have you had experience leading projects independently?",
    "faq.hr.leading.text": "Yes, both in teams and independently. In freelance and outsourcing projects, I led the full cycle from brief to release: research, design, handoff, and sometimes even light product management. In a product company, I also took ownership of features — from ideation to post-release analysis.",
    "faq.hr.deadlines.title": "⏳ Do you meet deadlines? How do you work in a multitasking environment?",
    "faq.hr.deadlines.text": "Yes, I consistently meet deadlines. I plan tasks in Notion or Trello, always leaving buffer time for iterations. In multitasking environments, I rely on prioritization frameworks (MoSCoW or Eisenhower), daily stand-ups, and focus blocks (Pomodoro). If a deadline is tight, I immediately inform the team and suggest trade-offs, such as scope reduction. Over the past few years, I have not missed any deadlines due to my fault.",
    "faq.hr.feedback.title": "👂 How do you react to negative feedback on your work?",
    "faq.hr.feedback.text1": "Calmly and constructively — negative feedback is always an opportunity to improve. First, I listen without becoming defensive and ask clarifying questions (“What exactly feels inconvenient?”, “Which user scenario causes the issue?”). Then I analyze the feedback: if it is well-founded, I acknowledge it and propose improvements. If it is subjective, I support my decision with arguments based on data, testing, and design guidelines. In any case, I thank the person for the feedback, as it helps me grow.",
    "faq.hr.feedback.text2": "For example, once a stakeholder wanted to remove a CTA button; after running a test, we brought it back and increased conversion by 12%.",
    "faq.hr.weaknesses.title": "🚧 What are your weaknesses?",
    "faq.hr.weaknesses.text": "I tend to be quite anxious — sometimes I worry too much about quality and deadlines and may overcheck my work. However, I have learned to manage this: I use clear checklists, apply time-boxing for reviews, and discuss risks with the team in advance. This helps me turn anxiety into attention to detail and reliability.",
    "faq.hr.trends.title": "📚 How do you stay up to date with design trends and new technologies?",
    "faq.hr.trends.text1": "I follow a range of newsletters and channels, including Nielsen Norman Group, UX Collective, Awwwards, Muz.li, The Verdict, the Figma Blog, and Designer News. I also follow designers who inspire me, such as Dasha — “Vsyo i tak yasno,” “Design Systems” by Vladislav Renk, and many others.",
    "faq.hr.trends.text2": "Whenever I come across a promising technology, I try to adopt it right away. For example, as soon as I learned about vibe coding and AI-assisted design, I tested it in a personal project and now actively use it to quickly generate and explore ideas.",
    "faq.hr.environment.title": "✨ Describe your ideal work environment",
    "faq.hr.environment.text": "I look for a friendly and supportive team that values its people and strives to build transparent, effective processes. An environment where one can grow both as a product and personally, experiment with approaches, improve team interaction, and create solutions that truly help users.",
    "faq.hr.newjob.title": "🔍 Why are you looking for a new job?",
    "faq.hr.newjob.text": "My current project has been successfully completed, and no new large-scale challenges are expected in the near future. I want to continue growing and working on products with a strong focus on the user. I am looking for a company with meaningful tasks, the ability to influence the product, and a team that actively experiments with new approaches.",
    "faq.hr.fiveyears.title": "🔮 Where do you see yourself in 5 years?",
    "faq.hr.fiveyears.text": "In five years, I see myself as a Senior or Lead UX Designer, or a Design Lead for a small team. I want to deeply develop expertise in product design, research, and strategic thinking — helping companies build products that solve real problems. I plan to mentor juniors, develop design systems, and influence product strategy. Ideally — growing within a strong team where design is on par with business and development.",
    "faq.tech.requirements.title": "🎯 How do you define feature requirements and priorities?",
    "faq.tech.requirements.text1": "I start by aligning with the product team and stakeholders on goals, user needs, and constraints (technical, budget, timeline). Then I conduct research: analyzing existing data, interviewing users, and reviewing competitors and current solutions.",
    "faq.tech.requirements.text2": "In practice, even with a small team (3–4 people), I use a simple prioritization approach: I list all features, evaluate them based on user and business impact, and estimate implementation complexity. For example, in a mobile app project for a B2B store, we identified the top three features that solved key user pain points — improving product search, quick access to orders, and status notifications. These features were implemented in the first iteration, while less critical ones were scheduled for the next sprint.",
    "faq.tech.figma.title": "🎨 Describe your workflow in Figma",
    "faq.tech.figma.text": "I start with research → create user flows in FigJam → low-fidelity wireframes → mid/high-fidelity designs using auto-layout. Everything is built with components and variants. I store colors, spacing, and typography in variables (with modes for light/dark). I hand off to Dev Mode and, if needed, provide a component specification.",
    "faq.tech.consistency.title": "🏗️ How do you maintain consistency when working on a large project?",
    "faq.tech.consistency.text": "I maintain consistency by creating and managing a design system: foundation (colors, typography, spacing, icons) and components with variants. I use variables and tokens so changes propagate automatically across the interface. All components are documented in Figma or Notion. Regular design reviews and team syncs ensure a unified style, while auto-layout and standardized naming minimize errors.",
    "faq.tech.designsystem.title": "📐 How do you organize a design system in Figma?",
    "faq.tech.designsystem.text": "I create a separate library file with the foundation (colors, typography, icons, spacing) and components (buttons, cards, forms). Everything is built with variants and properties. Naming follows a BEM-like or Atomic Design structure, e.g., foundation/color/primary, components/button/primary/large. I also include documentation within the file in a separate frame.",
    "faq.tech.variables.title": "🔢 How do you work with variables in Figma?",
    "faq.tech.variables.text": "I create collections for colors (primary, accent, neutral, semantic — success/error), spacing (base 4px → multiples), and typography (font family + scale: header, text, caption). I configure modes: light/dark theme, brand A/brand B, dense/normal. All variables are linked to components — when switching modes, the entire interface updates automatically.",
    "faq.tech.hierarchy.title": "👁️ What is visual hierarchy and how do you build it?",
    "faq.tech.hierarchy.text": "Visual hierarchy is how the user's eye instantly perceives the importance of elements. I create it using size, contrast, color, spacing, and placement. The most important elements are larger, brighter, higher, and to the left. I check in black-and-white mode — if everything is readable, the hierarchy works.",
    "faq.tech.typography.title": "🔠 How do you work with a typographic scale?",
    "faq.tech.typography.text": "I use a modular scale (usually Major Third or Perfect Fourth) to define font sizes. I establish a set of styles: H1-H6 for headers, Body (Large, Regular, Small) for text, and Caption/Overline for auxiliary details. I always check line height (usually 1.2 for headers, 1.5 for text) to ensure readability.",

    "faq.hr.trends.text1": "I follow a range of newsletters and channels, including Nielsen Norman Group, UX Collective, Awwwards, Muz.li, The Verdict, the Figma Blog, and Designer News. I also follow designers who inspire me, such as Dasha — “Vsyo i tak yasno,” “Design Systems” by Vladislav Renk, and many others.",
    "faq.hr.trends.text2": "Whenever I come across a promising technology, I try to adopt it right away. For example, as soon as I learned about vibe coding and AI-assisted design, I tested it in a personal project and now actively use it to quickly generate and explore ideas.",
    "faq.hr.environment.title": "✨ Describe your ideal work environment",
    "faq.hr.environment.text": "I look for a friendly and supportive team that values its people and strives to build transparent, effective processes. An environment where one can grow both as a product and personally, experiment with approaches, improve team interaction, and create solutions that truly help users.",
    "faq.hr.newjob.title": "🔍 Why are you looking for a new job?",
    "faq.hr.newjob.text": "My current project has been successfully completed, and no new large-scale challenges are expected in the near future. I want to continue growing and working on products with a strong focus on the user. I am looking for a company with meaningful tasks, the ability to influence the product, and a team that actively experiments with new approaches.",
    "faq.hr.fiveyears.title": "🔮 Where do you see yourself in 5 years?",
    "faq.hr.fiveyears.text": "In five years, I see myself as a Senior or Lead UX Designer, or a Design Lead for a small team. I want to deeply develop expertise in product design, research, and strategic thinking — helping companies build products that solve real problems. I plan to mentor juniors, develop design systems, and influence product strategy. Ideally — growing within a strong team where design is on par with business and development.",
    "faq.tech.requirements.title": "🎯 How do you define feature requirements and priorities?",
    "faq.tech.requirements.text1": "I start by aligning with the product team and stakeholders on goals, user needs, and constraints (technical, budget, timeline). Then I conduct research: analyzing existing data, interviewing users, and reviewing competitors and current solutions.",
    "faq.tech.requirements.text2": "In practice, even with a small team (3–4 people), I use a simple prioritization approach: I list all features, evaluate them based on user and business impact, and estimate implementation complexity. For example, in a mobile app project for a B2B store, we identified the top three features that solved key user pain points — improving product search, quick access to orders, and status notifications. These features were implemented in the first iteration, while less critical ones were scheduled for the next sprint.",
    "faq.tech.figma.title": "🎨 Describe your workflow in Figma",
    "faq.tech.figma.text": "I start with research → create user flows in FigJam → low-fidelity wireframes → mid/high-fidelity designs using auto-layout. Everything is built with components and variants. I store colors, spacing, and typography in variables (with modes for light/dark). I hand off to Dev Mode and, if needed, provide a component specification.",
    "faq.tech.consistency.title": "🏗️ How do you maintain consistency when working on a large project?",
    "faq.tech.consistency.text": "I maintain consistency by creating and managing a design system: foundation (colors, typography, spacing, icons) and components with variants. I use variables and tokens so changes propagate automatically across the interface. All components are documented in Figma or Notion. Regular design reviews and team syncs ensure a unified style, while auto-layout and standardized naming minimize errors.",
    "faq.tech.designsystem.title": "📐 How do you organize a design system in Figma?",
    "faq.tech.designsystem.text": "I create a separate library file with the foundation (colors, typography, icons, spacing) and components (buttons, cards, forms). Everything is built with variants and properties. Naming follows a BEM-like or Atomic Design structure, e.g., foundation/color/primary, components/button/primary/large. I also include documentation within the file in a separate frame.",
    "faq.tech.variables.title": "🔢 How do you work with variables in Figma?",
    "faq.tech.variables.text": "I create collections for colors (primary, accent, neutral, semantic — success/error), spacing (base 4px → multiples), and typography (font family + scale: header, text, caption). I configure modes: light/dark theme, brand A/brand B, dense/normal. All variables are linked to components — when switching modes, the entire interface updates automatically.",
    "faq.tech.hierarchy.title": "👁️ What is visual hierarchy and how do you build it?",
    "faq.tech.hierarchy.text": "Visual hierarchy is how the user's eye instantly perceives the importance of elements. I create it using size, contrast, color, spacing, and placement. The most important elements are larger, brighter, higher, and to the left. I check in black-and-white mode — if everything is readable, the hierarchy works.",
    "faq.tech.typography.title": "🔠 How do you work with a typographic scale?",
    "faq.tech.typography.text": "I use a modular scale (usually Major Third or Perfect Fourth) to define font sizes. I establish a set of styles: H1-H6 for headers, Body (Large, Regular, Small) for text, and Caption/Overline for auxiliary details. I always check line height (usually 1.2 for headers, 1.5 for text) to ensure readability.",
    "faq.tech.responsive.title": "📱 How do you handle responsive/adaptive design?",
    "faq.tech.responsive.text": "I follow a mobile-first approach. I use auto-layout with min/max width, wrap, hug/fill. Breakpoints: 360–428px for mobile, 768px for tablet, 1024–1440px for desktop. I test in prototypes with different frame sizes.",
    "faq.tech.color.title": "🌗 How do you ensure color accessibility?",
    "faq.tech.color.text": "I check contrast according to WCAG 2.2: at least 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text. I use Figma plugins like Stark or Contrast. Semantic colors are always verified for text-on-background and interactive states.",
    "faq.tech.inclusivity.title": "♿ How do you ensure inclusivity and accessibility?",
    "faq.tech.inclusivity.text": "I consider it from the first screen: contrast, keyboard navigation, alt texts, large touch targets (min 44×44px), and simple language. I test with tools like axe DevTools and, if possible, with people with different abilities.",
    "faq.tech.handoff.title": "📦 How do you hand off designs to developers?",
    "faq.tech.handoff.text": "Via Figma Dev Mode: developers can inspect and copy CSS / iOS / Android values. For large systems, I export tokens (JSON) using the Tokens Studio plugin and provide them to the codebase. I also create redlines for spacing and write a brief specification in Notion or Jira.",
    "faq.tech.abtesting.title": "🧪 Experience with A/B testing and making data-driven decisions",
    "faq.tech.abtesting.text": "I use A/B testing to validate hypotheses and assess the impact of changes on users. For example, I tested different CTA button variants — based on conversion data, we selected the version that increased conversion by 12%. I make data-driven decisions using metrics like engagement, conversion rates, heatmaps, and behavior analytics. If results are inconclusive, I conduct additional tests or user interviews to understand the reasons.",
    "faq.tech.ai.title": "🤖 What is your approach to AI in design?",
    "faq.tech.ai.text": "AI is useful at the ideation stage and for generating variants (Midjourney, Galileo, Figma AI for layout). However, I always refine the final design manually — AI doesn’t yet understand context, brand, or accessibility fully.",

Середовище, де можна рости як продукту, так і особисто, експериментувати з підходами, покращувати командну взаємодію та створювати рішення, які справді допомагають користувачам.",

    "faq.hr.newjob.title": "🔍 Чому ви шукаєте нову роботу?",
    "faq.hr.newjob.text": "Поточний проект успішно завершено, і нових масштабних викликів найближчим часом не передбачається. Я хочу продовжувати рости та працювати над продуктами з сильним фокусом на користувача. Шукаю компанію, де є змістовні задачі, можливість впливати на продукт і команда, яка активно експериментує з новими підходами.",

    "faq.hr.fiveyears.title": "🔮 Ким ви бачите себе через 5 років?",
    "faq.hr.fiveyears.text": "Через п'ять років я бачу себе на позиції Senior або Lead UX дизайнера, або дизайн-лідом невеликої команди. Хочу глибоко розвинути експертизу в продуктовому дизайні, дослідженнях та стратегічному мисленні — допомагати компаніям будувати продукти, що вирішують реальні проблеми. Планую менторити джуніорів, розвивати дизайн-системи та впливати на продуктову стратегію. Ідеально — рости всередині сильної команди, де дизайн на рівних з бізнесом і розробкою.",

    "faq.tech.requirements.title": "🎯 Як ви визначаєте вимоги та пріоритети фіч?",
    "faq.tech.requirements.text1": "Я починаю з узгодження цілей, потреб користувачів та обмежень (технічних, бюджетних, часових) з продуктовою командою та стейкхолдерами. Потім проводжу дослідження: аналіз існуючих даних, інтерв'ю з користувачами, огляд конкурентів та поточних рішень.",
    "faq.tech.requirements.text2": "На практиці, навіть з невеликою командою (3–4 людини), я використовую простий підхід до пріоритезації: виписую всі фічі, оцінюю їх за впливом на користувача та бізнес, і оцінюю складність реалізації. Наприклад, у проекті мобільного додатку для B2B магазину ми визначили топ-3 фічі, що вирішували ключові болі користувачів — покращення пошуку товарів, швидкий доступ до замовлень та сповіщення про статус. Ці фічі пішли в першу ітерацію, а менш критичні — у наступний спринт.",

    "faq.tech.figma.title": "🎨 Опишіть ваш робочий процес у Figma",
    "faq.tech.figma.text": "Починаю з досліджень → створюю user flows у FigJam → low-fidelity вайрфрейми → mid/high-fidelity дизайн з використанням auto-layout. Все будую на компонентах та варіантах. Кольори, відступи та типографіку зберігаю у змінних (variables) (з режимами для світлої/темної теми). Передаю в Dev Mode і, за потреби, надаю специфікацію компонентів.",

    "faq.tech.consistency.title": "🏗️ Як ви підтримуєте консистентність у великому проекті?",
    "faq.tech.consistency.text": "Я підтримую консистентність через створення та ведення дизайн-системи: фундамент (кольори, типографіка, відступи, іконки) та компоненти з варіантами. Використовую змінні (variables) та токени, щоб зміни автоматично поширювалися на весь інтерфейс. Всі компоненти документую у Figma або Notion. Регулярні дизайн-рев'ю та синки з командою забезпечують єдиний стиль, а auto-layout і стандартизований неймінг мінімізують помилки.",

    "faq.tech.designsystem.title": "📐 Як ви організовуєте дизайн-систему у Figma?",
    "faq.tech.designsystem.text": "Створюю окремий файл-бібліотеку з фундаментом (кольори, типографіка, іконки, відступи) та компонентами (кнопки, картки, форми). Все побудовано на варіантах та властивостях (properties). Неймінг за структурою BEM або Atomic Design, наприклад, foundation/color/primary, components/button/primary/large. Також включаю документацію всередині файлу в окремому фреймі.",

    "faq.tech.variables.title": "🔢 Як ви працюєте зі змінними (variables) у Figma?",
    "faq.tech.variables.text": "Створюю колекції для кольорів (primary, accent, neutral, semantic — success/error), відступів (база 4px → кратні значення) та типографіки (сімейство шрифтів + шкала: заголовок, текст, підпис). Налаштовую режими (modes): світла/темна тема, бренд А/бренд Б, dense/normal. Всі змінні прив'язані до компонентів — при зміні режиму весь інтерфейс оновлюється автоматично.",

    "faq.tech.hierarchy.title": "👁️ Що таке візуальна ієрархія і як ви її будуєте?",
    "faq.tech.hierarchy.text": "Візуальна ієрархія — це те, як око користувача миттєво зчитує важливість елементів. Я створюю її за допомогою розміру, контрасту, кольору, відступів та розташування. Найважливіші елементи — більші, яскравіші, вищі та лівіше. Перевіряю в чорно-білому режимі — якщо все читається, ієрархія працює.",

    "faq.tech.typography.title": "🔠 Як ви працюєте з типографічною шкалою?",
    "faq.tech.typography.text": "Використовую модульну шкалу (наприклад, 1.25 або 1.333). Базовий текст — 16px, заголовки від 24px до 48px. Впроваджую fluid typography (гумову типографіку) через змінні, щоб вона пропорційно масштабувалася на мобайлі та десктопі.",

    "faq.tech.responsive.title": "📱 Як ви працюєте з адаптивним (responsive) дизайном?",
    "faq.tech.responsive.text": "Дотримуюсь підходу mobile-first. Використовую auto-layout з min/max width, wrap, hug/fill. Брейкпоінти: 360–428px для мобайлу, 768px для планшету, 1024–1440px для десктопу. Тестую в прототипах з різними розмірами фреймів.",

    "faq.tech.color.title": "🌗 Як ви забезпечуєте доступність кольорів?",
    "faq.tech.color.text": "Перевіряю контрастність за стандартом WCAG 2.2: мінімум 4.5:1 для звичайного тексту, 3:1 для великого. Використовую плагіни Figma, такі як Stark або Contrast. Семантичні кольори завжди перевіряються на фоні та в інтерактивних станах.",

    "faq.tech.inclusivity.title": "♿ Як ви забезпечуєте інклюзивність та доступність?",
    "faq.tech.inclusivity.text": "Враховую це з першого екрану: контрастність, навігація з клавіатури, alt-тексти, великі зони натискання (мін. 44×44px) та проста мова. Тестую інструментами типу axe DevTools і, за можливості, з людьми з різними можливостями.",

    "faq.tech.handoff.title": "📦 Як ви передаєте дизайн розробникам?",
    "faq.tech.handoff.text": "Через Figma Dev Mode: розробники можуть інспектувати та копіювати значення CSS / iOS / Android. Для великих систем експортую токени (JSON) через плагін Tokens Studio та передаю їх у кодову базу. Також роблю redlines (розмітку відступів) та пишу коротку специфікацію в Notion або Jira.",

    "faq.tech.abtesting.title": "🧪 Чи є досвід A/B тестування та прийняття рішень на основі даних?",
    "faq.tech.abtesting.text": "Використовую A/B тестування для перевірки гіпотез та оцінки впливу змін на користувачів. Наприклад, тестувала різні варіанти CTA-кнопки — на основі даних конверсії ми обрали варіант, що підвищив конверсію на 12%. Приймаю рішення на основі метрик: залучення, конверсія, теплові карти та аналітика поведінки. Якщо результати неоднозначні — проводжу додаткові тестування або інтерв'ю, щоб зрозуміти причини.",

    "faq.tech.ai.title": "🤖 Який ваш підхід до AI в дизайні?",
    "faq.tech.ai.text": "AI корисний на етапі ідеї та генерації варіантів (Midjourney, Galileo, Figma AI для макету). Проте фінальний дизайн завжди допрацьовую вручну — AI поки що не розуміє контексту, бренду та доступності в повній мірі.",
